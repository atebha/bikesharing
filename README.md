# bikesharing

Purpose:

To present a Vendor inquirysual analysis of Bike usage in NYC.

Analysis:

The storyboard contains visual on bike usage by time such as week day, user type, and gender. 

Challenges:

The gender column would not take the numbers as string code to convert the integer values to a string. I used the caption function as a work around to still provide context for the user. The filesize of the updated dataset csv is too big to upload.
